      "the military careers of the Earls of Manchester   and Essex. Though the embryonic New Model Army \n",
      "would become immensely formidable in the course   of months and years, it needed time to fill its \n",

      "factions in Ireland signed a peace   which freed up English royalist soldiers \n",
      "to be sent over to assist the king.   The agreement also allowed the Irish Confederates, \n",
      "whose alliances were constantly shifting,   to renew their war against the Presbyterian Scots \n",
      "and parliamentarians. Therefore, at the end of   June 1644 therefore, 2,000 Irish mercenaries \n",
      "raised by the royalist Earl of Antrim sailed to   Ardnamurchan in Scotland under Alasdair MacColla. \n",
      "Upon landing, MacColla immediately began rallying   highland chiefs who were bitterly hostile to the \n",
      "Covenanter Campbell clan, such as leaders of the   Macphersons and MacDonalds, to war. Meanwhile, \n",
      "in Oxford, James Graham, otherwise known as the   Marquis of Montrose, had defected from the \n",
      "Covenanters before the civil war began. With   the threat of his countryman’s pro-parliamentarian \n",
      "intervention at the forefront, Charles appointed   Montrose his Lord Lieutenant in Scotland and sent \n",
      "him north with only two loyal companions. When   Montrose arrived, he joined with MacColla at Blair \n",
      "Atholl and the two immediately made common cause.   This was convenient for both men because, \n",
      "as Stuart Reid points out “Montrose was   in need of an army and MacColla was just \n",
      "as desperately in need of an employer.”  This ragtag army of unlikely Celtic allies and \n",
      "even unlikelier royalists moved south to Perth.   Outside of the city on the plains of Tippermuir, \n",
      "Montrose and MacColla defeated a Covenanter   army about the same size as their own, whose \n",
      "infantry was primarily made up of raw recruits.   Soon, they learned that a larger Covenanter \n",
      "force was assembling at Stirling.   Seeking to get clear of it and to raise \n",
      "local allies, Montrose marched north and   bypassed Dundee on the way to Aberdeen, \n",
      "where another enemy army awaited him.   Despite facing an army that outnumbered his own \n",
      "and which had taken a strong position, Montrose   and his Irish colleague smashed the Covenanter \n",
      "loyalists again, inflicting 520 casualties and   suffering only minimal losses of their own.\n",
      "Due to the death of his favourite drummer boy,   who was shot in cold blood during pre-battle \n",
      "negotiations, Montrose let his troops viciously   sack Aberdeen for four days on September 13th, \n",
      "1644. This event, fueled by generations-long   blood feuds and sectarian hatred, would become \n",
      "known as Black Friday. In October 1644, Montrose   campaigned throughout Aberdeenshire against his \n",
      "Covenanter rival - the Earl of Argyll, meeting his   numerically superior forces in battle at Fyvie, \n",
      "where neither side was able to gain an advantage.   When winter drew in, Argyll went back to \n",
      "Strathbogie and Montrose marched back over   the hills to Blair Atholl. Far more consequential \n",
      "than simply beating a few small Scottish armies,   Montrose’s actions were beginning to affect \n",
      "the war’s greater strategic situation.   The Covenanter government, growing concerned \n",
      "with royalist success in their backyard,   ordered Leven to detach 9 regiments of his own \n",
      "army, led by Marston Moor veteran William Baillie,   to stop Montrose. Argyll and Baillie managed to \n",
      "unite their forces, but constant disagreement led   to the two men parting company soon after. \n",
      "Montrose, unwilling to give his rivals a   moment to relax, undertook a perilous march \n",
      "and descended on Argyll’s 3,000-strong army   with 1,500 of his own at Inverlochy on February \n",
      "2nd. Again, the Marquess won a complete victory   against a vastly superior force. These events \n",
      "ensured that Covenanter priorities would be   directed away from winning the war in England and \n",
      "diverted the attention of Leven’s army away from   the brewing campaign of 1645. Instead, they \n",
      "remained in the Scottish Marches to prevent   Montrose from receiving reinforcements from \n",
      "Charles. The Parliamentarians were on their own.  With the royalists lacking any real strategic \n",
      "direction and parliament waiting for its new army   to sharpen its claws, campaigning in the south \n",
      "began in a disjointed manner. In the west, an   array of the king’s commanders attempted to secure \n",
      "the Welsh marches and take pressure off Chester.   In the far south, Lord Goring ravaged Hampshire \n",
      "before retreating to Salisbury at the end of   January. Hundreds of miles north, Marmaduke \n",
      "Langdale’s northern horse managed to relieve   Pontefract in early March, and was back in the \n",
      "royalist stronghold of Newark by March 4th.   The Committee of Both Kingdoms fired the opening \n",
      "shot in parliament’s 1645 campaign by ordering   Cromwell, who had returned from sparring with \n",
      "Goring’s forces in the west country just east   of Oxford on April 21st. Meanwhile, Fairfax led \n",
      "the bulk of the New Model Army from Windsor to   Reading, where he and his 10,000 were resupplied. \n",
      "While the now fully-supplied Fairfax set about   marching west to save Taunton from siege4, \n",
      "Cromwell repeatedly harassed Charles’ forces near   their capital, brazenly seizing all the carthorses \n",
      "which would be needed to transport artillery and   preventing the royal army from leaving. However, \n",
      "when Goring and his 4,000 returning cavalry   encountered Cromwell at Radcot Bridge on May \n",
      "3rd, the parliamentarian horse retreated south5   into friendly territory. With the troublesome \n",
      "parliamentary cavalry commander out of the way,   Charles marched from Oxford to Stow-on-the-Wold \n",
      "with his troops, where he conferred with prominent   royalist leaders including Goring, Rupert, and \n",
      "others. Once again, the council of war argued   about the correct course to take, eventually \n",
      "concluding that Goring and 3,000 horse would split   off west and bring Taunton into royalist hands, \n",
      "while the main royalist army would go north.   Reacting to the enemy’s movement, the Committee \n",
      "changed its mind about the New Model Army’s   goals and sent its leader new orders. Reluctantly \n",
      "obeying, Fairfax sent four regiments to Taunton   and turned most of his soldiers back with the \n",
      "aim of an eventual rendezvous with Cromwell.  The latter shadowed Charles’ army from afar as it \n",
      "marched toward Chester, but was unable to prevent   the royalists from lifting the siege there6. \n",
      "Parliament sent messages asking Leven for aid,   but Montrose’s continuing success in Scotland left \n",
      "the Covenanters unable and unwilling to divert   resources south. Partially because the Committee \n",
      "believed that Oxford would surrender without a   fight due to bad information, Fairfax was ordered \n",
      "to besiege the city beginning May 21st, news which   reached the royalists only a few days later. \n",
      "In response, Charles’ field army unexpectedly   pivoted and began marching southeast towards \n",
      "Leicester, an important parliamentary garrison   which was reached just over a week later. Aiming \n",
      "to distract the New Model Army besieging their   increasingly food-deprived capital, the royalists \n",
      "attacked. A savage two-day clash over the town’s   defences and a veritable ‘violent storme’ of \n",
      "cannon shot followed, after which Leicester’s   garrison was overwhelmed, and the city stormed \n",
      "and looted. However, 400 royalist troops were dead   and many times more wounded, depleting the king’s \n",
      "strength severely. Seeing the danger of continuing   the fight and having gained much plunder, \n",
      "soldiers began to desert Charles’ and head home.   His remaining army stayed in and around Leicester \n",
      "until June 4th when it moved on to Daventry.   Meanwhile, the fall of such an important \n",
      "midlands garrison prompted the Committee’s   order for Fairfax to raise the Siege of Oxford and \n",
      "go bring Charles to battle. On June 9th 1645, two   key decisions were made by parliament. Firstly, \n",
      "Fairfax was given ‘strategic independence’   from the Committee. Secondly Oliver Cromwell, \n",
      "parliament’s rising star, was confirmed in his   assignment to the heretofore vacant position of \n",
      "Lieutenant-General of Horse in the New Model Army.  Realising that a fight might be on the horizon, \n",
      "Prince Rupert ordered an increasingly lethargic   Lord Goring to return from the west \n",
      "county. However Goring’s response letter,   which reiterated his temporary inability to return \n",
      "and pleaded the king not to fight until he did,   was intercepted by the New Model Army. This \n",
      "intelligence coup had two-fold consequences. It   alerted Fairfax that he didn’t have to worry about \n",
      "Goring reinforcing the king, while also depriving   the king of any knowledge that he was not going to \n",
      "be reinforced. Now confident about their chances,   Fairfax and Cromwell moved closer to the royalist \n",
      "position, which the efficient scouts of the New   Model Army reported to be close by. The royalists \n",
      "attempted a retreat north to recruit more troops,   but as they did their rear-guard was constantly \n",
      "harassed by parliamentarian cavalry attacks.   It became clear near the Northamptonshire town of \n",
      "Naseby that a key decision had to be made: Prince   Rupert uncharacteristically ordered a further \n",
      "withdrawal and avoidance of battle, but his advice   was not heeded. The king would stand and fight.\n",
      "At this point it’s worth examining the armies   which faced off on that historic day in summer \n",
      "1645. Deprived of its northern manpower base, the   royalist force deploying on Dust Hill near Naseby \n",
      "was far diminished from that which had done battle   at Marston Moor the year before. Its core infantry \n",
      "brigades in the first and second lines numbered   3,500 veteran soldiers comprising 2,925 musketeers \n",
      "and 575 pikemen. In the left centre were the   regiments of Sir George Lisle and to his right \n",
      "were arrayed units under Henry Bard as well as the   Queen’s personal Lifeguard. In the right centre \n",
      "were regiments under the command of Sir Edward   Hopton on the inside and the Duke of York on the \n",
      "outside. Three further regiments of foot drew   up in the second line while Prince Rupert, King \n",
      "Charles and a mixed reserve stayed in the rear,   made up of the king’s personal lifeguard horse and \n",
      "foot, in addition to Prince Rupert’s ‘Bluecoats’.   Interspersed between the ranks of infantry were \n",
      "three small divisions of cavalry - two behind   the vanguard and one more behind the second \n",
      "line. On the royalist left flank were roughly   1,700 horse in three divisions, including \n",
      "Marmaduke Langdale’s northern troopers.   They were drawn up in the Swedish manner, with \n",
      "200 musketeers lined up between each unit.   Charles’ other wing, anchored on a series of \n",
      "hedges, mirrored its counterpart in strength,   and was under Prince Maurice’s authority. This \n",
      "gathering of cavalry comprised Rupert’s most   elite units and lifeguard divisions, revered units \n",
      "which had served with distinction since Edgehill.   They also had musketeers accompanying \n",
      "them. Overall, the royalist army at Naseby   counted among their ranks about 10,000 to 10,500 \n",
      "soldiers, just over half of them mounted troops.  After some prompting from Cromwell, the \n",
      "numerically superior New Model Army took   up a position on the opposing Closter Hill, \n",
      "the red and blue uniforms of its soldiers   making it stand out on the verdant landscape. \n",
      "Its pike and musketeer infantry in the middle   probably numbered around 8,500 in three lines \n",
      "of battle - five regiments were in the first,   three manned the second and half-a-regiment was \n",
      "in the third. The foot was led on the tactical   level by Philip Skippon, one of parliament's \n",
      "most veteran infantry commanders, while Lord   General Sir Thomas Fairfax was with his reserve, \n",
      "overseeing the battle from a strategic distance.   On the wings, Lieutenant-General of Horse Cromwell \n",
      "commanded 4,000 mounted troops on the right,   including the now-infamous Ironsides. On the other \n",
      "wing was Henry Ireton - Cromwell’s son-in-law,   who opposed Maurice with about \n",
      "2,500 on the parliamentarian left.  At around 9:30 in the morning on June 14th, \n",
      "Cromwell surveyed the situation from his   elevated position8 on Mill Hill. He became \n",
      "determined to exploit a potential opportunity   in a feature which anchored the western side of \n",
      "the parliamentarian formation - the Sulby hedges.   The Lieutenant-General energetically \n",
      "rode away to the rear and arrived,   half a mile later, in the presence of a \n",
      "dragoon contingent under Colonel John Okey.   At Cromwell’s direct instruction, the Colonel’s \n",
      "dragoons mounted their horses, moved out beyond   the hedgeline and ascended the slope beyond. \n",
      "After riding west of the bushes for a short while,   fully visible to the royalist army, the dragoons \n",
      "approached Maurice’s right side cavalry.   There, they were met by volley after volley \n",
      "of musketry from units who had prepared in   advance for their arrival, and were forced \n",
      "to withdraw down a small slope for cover.   From their now-superior position, Okey’s dragoons \n",
      "laid down a withering fire on the royal cavalry   from beyond Sulby hedge, disordering their \n",
      "formation and causing significant losses…   Receiving reports of a developing situation \n",
      "of the right wing which required attention,   Prince Rupert moved out from his position behind \n",
      "the royalist foot to appraise the situation.   Upon arriving, it was immediately clear \n",
      "that Maurice’s horse could not withstand   such harassment in their current position, \n",
      "and so were ordered to advance immediately.   After moving out of range, the royalist cavalry \n",
      "took a moment to halt, reordering themselves   before launching a thunderous charge. Opposite \n",
      "them, Henry Ireton’s horse returned the gesture,   galloping down Sulby Hill and meeting \n",
      "their foe at its base in a fierce clash.   On the inside, closer to the infantry, Vermuyden \n",
      "and Ireton’s units were incredibly effective,   routing three cavalry divisions opposite them \n",
      "and then moving to wheel on the royalist center.   This proved to be a mistake. Rupert’s units on \n",
      "the outside decisively swept the parliamentarian   horse arrayed against them off the field and then \n",
      "turned to crash into the now-distracted Ireton.   The latter’s forces completely collapsed at being \n",
      "hit in the rear and were routed from the field,   pursued towards the artillery train \n",
      "by the victorious units under Rupert.   Once again, the Prince had \n",
      "failed to press his advantage.  At this point - about 11am, Charles’ infantry \n",
      "vanguard began a forward march with its   right side angled slightly ahead of the rest. \n",
      "Unfortunately for the New Model Army, both their   muskets and heavy guns fired too high, barely \n",
      "inflicting any damage on the advancing veterans.   Upon contact, they drove through the central \n",
      "first line of roundhead foot amidst brutal   close quarters combat9, in which muskets were \n",
      "commonly used as clubs. All of this fighting   resulted in the creation of a deep semicircular \n",
      "salient around the victorious infantry brigades.   Despite their initial success, the king’s centre \n",
      "hadn’t yet made a decisive breakthrough and were   now attacked by new parliamentarian reserves \n",
      "from the front and flanks of the bulge.   As the clash of pike and musket continued, Sir \n",
      "Marmaduke Langdale’s northern horse on Dust Hill’s   eastern edge launched their own charge. Cromwell’s \n",
      "own first rank of cavalry mirrored their movements   and prepared for the engagement. The stalwart \n",
      "parliamentary horse almost immediately slowed the   progress of Langdale’s attack, but nevertheless \n",
      "the royalists fought doggedly, gradually pushing   Cromwell’s first line back through the rough, \n",
      "narrow terrain made up of rabbit warrens and   small hills. However, the northern cavalry was \n",
      "incredibly fatigued at this point, exhausted by   the heavy fighting against the Ironsides. Although \n",
