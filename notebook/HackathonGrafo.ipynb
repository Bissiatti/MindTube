      "but there's one nation with a story that's bigger than them all [Applause] china in china everything is about how do you accumulate more wealth it's a brutal system if you win you win big if you lose you lose everything the great wall of china sends a statement to foreigners it says this is what we can do not just to you but to ourselves what is it about china that makes this such a land of extremes it's a tale of war danger is anywhere and everywhere by the time the war was over china was essentially on its knees one thing that that could be sold to the chinese was opium it's a tale of adversity only in china can motherhood be not a joy but a crime they will break the bone and then bend your bones inward it's a tale of success at any cost chairman now is the red son in our hearts he once said it didn't matter to him if millions of people died if he got the utopia that he was hoping for you have an enormous number of teachers in high schools being beaten to death by their pupils but how long can china continue to play by its own rules it wasn't expected that a communist country would become possibly the world's biggest practitioner of capitalism for people who believe in the rule of law xi jinping is going to make your life not very pleasant the 21st century belongs to china and many previous centuries have as well to understand the mighty china to come you need to look back to her past and the biggest story of boom and bust in human history china home to nearly a fifth of all the people on the planet its population of almost 1.4 billion are living through extraordinary times they're part of one of the fastest growing economies in the world with average incomes rising fivefold in just 15 years in the 20 years since i moved out of china china has changed so dramatically the wealth the mental wealth in china phenomena and with that wealth has come one of the biggest building booms in history over the last few decades china has become probably the biggest building site in the world amazing modernized airports huge bridges highways high-speed trains shanghai has something like 2000 skyscrapers over 20 stories it's extraordinary how much building has happened such a huge proportion of the world's metals ores basic uh building blocks of construction have been going to china over a period of just three years china has used more cement than the united states did during the entire 20th century but to understand what drives this rampant explosion in construction and what feeds this fast ambition you need to look back into china's past because the last one thousand years tell the story of ancestors who proved that when this fast workforce is harnessed it can achieve progress on a scale other countries can only dream of one thousand years ago china was already a thriving country with a vibrant capital city its people had a developed culture it was way ahead of most other countries in the world and definitely i mean it's its capital city um was the largest in the world at the time had a population of some seven hundred thousand um and you know with streets ahead of any city anywhere else in the world london by comparison was a city of only twenty thousand much of china was ruled by emperor chen song the country we know today was a collection of ethnic groups tribes and kingdoms the biggest threat facing chen song was invasions from the north but he'd inherited a remarkable structure to keep the invaders out the great wall of china is a system of defense it's basically a boundary between china and those who live beyond it the chinese population on the whole lived in fear of invasions from the nomads beyond that boundary the great wall of china is the longest man-made structure on the planet one of the wonders of the world in total including all of its different branches the great wall stretches around five and a half thousand miles almost a quarter of the way around the world it's visited by more than 10 million people every year this engineering icon is the result of centuries of ongoing labour some of its sections built only of pounded earth are more than two thousand years old but by the time of emperor chen song one thousand years ago much of it was made of stone and was essential to protect his rule from invading nomads to the north sends a statement to the people of china that this is where the authority and the protection of the emperor stops i think also the great wall of china sends a statement to foreigners that says this is what we can do not just to you but to ourselves this is the level of industry and the level of dedication of of expense and of hard labor that we will put in to standing our ground only in china with its vast population would such an enormous construction have been possible so when the rest of the world was still in the dark ages how was china able to build such a vast structure the great wall of china was probably built to a large extent by people who were fulfilling a labor obligation they did their work as a kind of tax payment instead of collecting taxes in cash chinese emperors often required people to give up their labor instead every year able-bodied men had to serve the government building roads or building walls repairing walls and so on they were able to mobilize enormous numbers of people to do that it was a constantly replenished workforce that could be put to labor and it could be could be put to work to do these enormous projects huge investment of manpower was put into the building of that wall and it took you know a very very long time and many many lives were lost in the production of that wall generations ago the great wall of china set a marker for what this country and its people were capable of it was a sign that they could build bigger think bigger and mobilize a bigger workforce than anyone else on the planet one thousand years ago this was the world's first superpower but what would come next would be a dynasty that would transform the country and create a whole new brand that still dominates the world made in china a millennium ago china was the trailblazer that led the world today its people still think bigger than anyone else and in doing so they're changing their nation beyond recognition somebody had left the earth on a rocket in 1970 879 and returned to earth in 2019 and having left from china and returned to china they would not have recognized the place we are looking at two different worlds so what has been at the heart of this extraordinary growth the answer is a brand we've all come to know very well made in china the part that china's manufacturing industry plays in in the world is i mean it's just enormous i can remember trying to find a present for a chinese friend who's going to have a baby and you think well i'll get some wonderful toy and every single toy was made in china if you go into your kitchen slightly that you know most of the appliances use their toasters kettles they'll probably be made in china since the 1980s it's become you know the factory of the world it's very difficult to find something that isn't made in china these days including the camera that i'm talking to right now and the television that people are watching this on even a make america great again hats probably made in china but behind the story of huge national growth is a deeply rooted personal drive on the part of the chinese people chinese people really are very hungry for their own personal development i think it's in our blood to progress constantly as a human being and that determination to do whatever it takes to make a better life can be traced right back to one of china's most significant dynasties with 18 emperors spanning almost 300 years the song dynasty transformed china beyond recognition it was an amazingly successful moment in china's history it was way ahead of most other countries in the world the song was a period of um huge technological development of commercialization of specialization around 1100 midway through the dynasty a scroll was painted offering an extraordinary insight into what made song china so successful more than five meters long it depicts life in the capital city kaifang its treasures are still poured over by historians to this day in search of clues about this ancient world the society you see depicted on the ching ming squirrel is really not what you would see anywhere else it's an absolutely wonderful revelation of what the streets were like and it gives you this extraordinary picture of an incredibly lively and bustling town the painting gives a vivid insight into a people for whom the vibrancy of market life was at the heart of their culture shops lining the streets you had a very flourishing markets and also areas where different people would specialize you see people gathering for commercial activities buying things you see them flaunting their wares and for people in china today these kinds of markets still buzz with life day and night it was um very much a kind of modern city really with this kind of free trading going on all the time one of the crucial points that distinguished uh kaifung from previous chinese capitals was there was no curfew it's the city that never sleeps it just keeps on going and that vastly prolongs the amount of commerce and trade and industry that you can have so we have diarists from uh song era kaifang talking about for example enjoying the cafe culture going to the pub but then coming home and getting a kebab from a street seller on the way home we hear about the late night stores we have stories about um the antiques market that starts up before dawn because it's selling dodgy goods so everything just keeps on rolling and keeps on rolling it's possible to have 24 in our business and in the middle ages that vastly increases the amount of money you can make while europe was still in its medieval period dominated by an aristocracy china offered the possibility for people to get rich and rise up through the ranks of society there's more of a kind of mixing a more fluid society in which there are more opportunities for people to acquire the tools at least to be literate enough to be a merchant and that's a very different kind of culture that we don't really see until the 13th 14th century in european urban contexts whilst a good education in england was the preserve of only the very rich everyone in sung dynasty china was encouraged to aim for the top but getting to the top required a lot of hard work china was the first country to use competitive examinations for entry into the civil service bureaucracy if you wanted to get on in life truly the thing was to get an education we had no sense in europe at that time of as it were training people to become officials um you know you were there really by right of birth or not there is social mobility in china in a way that you don't see in other places in in the pre-modern period so there is social mobility because you could participate in the examinations and you could become a scholar you could in fact become a close advisor of the emperor regardless of where you had come from the sun was an empire that offered enormous possibilities for its population one thousand years later the possibility to improve your life through education is something that many people still pin their hopes on every year there's a competitive exam called the gaucho which essentially is a national university entrance examination it's widely feared and widely respected in some ways it's the inheritor of that historical tradition of over a thousand years of taking a very tough exam to get into the civil service bureaucracy chinese schools are so competitive in china everything is calculated on the marks on your paper if you have 90 points or you have 80 points that's your entire personal worth your fate is in this score if you get you know kind of a high score you can choose where you go if you don't you're really kind of uh almost sort of exiled from the system it's a a pretty brutal system in terms of you know if you win you win big if you lose you lose everything there are all sorts of tales around the galco even today there's one particularly notorious one of students who essentially were wired up to drips so they could have nutrients actually put into their bloodstream meaning they wouldn't actually have to move away even for a few minutes to eat and drink and making sure they could just study study study now that's an extreme case but it does show how seriously the gaucho is taken in china today it's bashed into you you need to compete very early on in your life in order to have a good position later on in chinese society in the west you will have no money you can still go to hospital you can still claim benefit in china such things hardly exist so the only thing you can count on is yourself and your family if it was under the sung dynasty that this sense of ambition was sewn into the fabric of chinese life it would be under the coming ming dynasty that the results of this extraordinary collective work ethic would make waves around the world the ming was a dynasty established by the only emperor in china's long history to have been born a peasant but that peasant would rise to become the hongwoo emperor founding a dynasty that would last almost 300 years its legacy would be immense and there's one iconic location which represents the boldness of the dynasty more than any other beijing's forbidden city would take over a million men more than 14 years to build the vast complex is spread over 180 acres and contains almost 1 000 buildings with walls as thick as 8 meters the palace was designed to be imposing glorious and terrifying the forbidden city has massive great sort of terracotta dark red walls which sort of loom as it were above you even now when you go into the forbidden city you get a sense that you are in the presence of the ruler of the world it's designed to be awe-inspiring it's designed to make you feel like you are insignificant you're faced with this this vast square and then this staircase going up to a huge palace where the ruler of the world lives so everything about the forbidden city is designed to to tell you that you are nothing the forbidden city would be home to a series of 24 emperors in their households and become the seat of chinese government for 500 years but the ming dynasty's most striking legacy was one that would almost come to define china itself you can't really separate the story of porcelain from the history of china you can't separate fine porcelain from china the country so how did porcelain put china on the map the answer lies in the southeastern city of jinder jin the place where the best ceramics in china were made is is a it's quite a small town it's quite low surrounded by wooded hills um but and it's full of the most extraordinary ceramic factories if you go to jindajan now you are in the middle of a place that does nothing but make porcelain in an age of astonishing achievements why would the porcelain produced here come to be one of the ming dynasty's defining legacies no one else could make something that was this hard this thin this strong and this bright in terms of its color effect its whiteness and the blue of the colors and it became a really popular item and blue and white since then has become the kind of epitome of main porcelain but the real secret to jinder jin's success was how the porcelain was produced instead of a potter doing the whole process people are working together next to each other on separate tasks they are not responsible for the whole process but it is a sequence of actions that have to be completed that all fit together which increases productivity and efficiency and reliability so all of those are very modern terms and yet you know in the 15th century that's how they were producing thousands and thousands of pieces of ceramics inching their jen which is extraordinary it is a kind of precursor to factory production hundreds of years before china became the workshop of the world jinder jin had become one of the world's first factory lines churning out porcelain on an industrial scale so i think that is the first place in the world where they were producing in these quantities to this quality like this i think china very early came into this idea of sort of um you know not you don't have to see something through from beginning to end at all you you produce in a factory manner in the most efficient manner the person who's good at this does that the next person does this and so on it's sort of mind-boggling these quantities of porcelains that were being made in jingdae that bar scale of production menting dejin ceramics could be bought and sold across the world and become some of the most highly prized products on the planet nobody in europe had seen anything like chinese porcelain the queen had great piles of porcelain on all her mantelpieces and people spent huge sums of money on people could be bankrupted pretty well by collecting porcelain these were about power and wealth and status and fashion they became very very much part of the kind of fashion of the day ming dynasty porcelain became so sought after it achieved something the world had perhaps never seen before it became a brand i would write the name of the rain period of the emperor at the base so you look at underneath it you can see the characters and it says shrender and the shrender emperor really represents the top of the of the finest pieces of porcelain made in the gym and ever since even a hundred years after that those same characters get copied onto all kinds of pieces that weren't made in the shender rain period at all but as a way of kind of branding the piece it's a sort of marketing some people say that the blue and white is is as a whole the first brand you know that it is like a brand it's so familiar it's so strikingly distinguishable whichever pattern it is if it's blue and white you immediately recognize it as a piece of blue and white centuries ago china was already a commercial pioneer manufacturing marketing and selling on an immense scale to the world and today for her vast workforce being part of the great national factory is more than just a job it's a way of life for many migrant workers who come from the countryside to work in the cities it's not possible for them to go home and therefore their place of work actually becomes their place of sleep eating and rest as well so a factory is not just where you work it's your whole life too they have their sleeping cultures with dorm tree they stay with up to eight people 12 people in one room and then they go to the work in another pot and then they go to food into the canteen everything is together i really wish this people were not treating them very well because they are very easily replaced and yet people do it in their hundreds of millions to make their lives better it's a work ethic deeply rooted in the history of china but even that hard work wouldn't be enough to save the country from the darkest chapter in its history mighty china was about to begin a remarkable reversal of fortunes one that would threaten its very survival and it all began with the arrival of the british over the last 1 000 years china has seen its fortunes rise and fall but today it's very much in the ascendance it's big it's booming and it's seemingly unstoppable the manufacturing capital of the world its economy has swelled making it the second richest country on the planet but with wealth comes power and that's making a lot of people very nervous we're having a little spat with china and we'll win it we put a lot of tariffs on china today as you know they put some on us we put a lot on them but today's trade war isn't the only issue between china and the west the future of hong kong and her people continues to make headlines it's a dispute which has its roots in a dark chapter of chinese history that would change the country forever the ming dynasty had seen an explosion of exports around the world from their sought after porcelain to their fine silks this success would continue under the qing dynasty that followed but by the 18th century there was something else from china that we wanted in britain even more tea there was a great appetite for tea as a product that at first i think was considered something of a luxury something for the elites but i think began slowly but surely to spread throughout society he had just become fashionable beyond belief and tea was a sort of necessity the british and i mean you know something like 10 percent of the national spending was on t i mean it was enormous amount and we couldn't find anything to swap it for with the chinese we were having to pay silver because they didn't want indian cotton they didn't want wolves from woolens from bradford and so on we had nothing that the chinese wanted but of course having to flow a great deal of britain's silver out into china was not something that looked good from the point of view of the national accounts so there was a very urgent search for some kind of good that could be traded instead into the chinese market the british sent a delegation to china to offer our wares but the emperor was unimpressed china was responsible for about a third of global industrial output far greater than victorian england was responsible for china was big enough that it could produce almost everything it needed unfortunately it was discovered that one thing that that could be sold to the chinese was opium british traders realized they could grow opium in recently conquered india and sell it for a profit in china opium became extremely widely used in china in the 19th century it was used at all levels of society the opium crisis in china reached the stage where there were 12 million addicts in the country and and that level of uh of business for drug dealers but also for uh the medical implications and the criminal implications uh was something the chinese couldn't ignore china decided to take action lindsay is the qing dynasty official of the late 19th century he was essentially tasked with trying to eliminate the opium trade he impounded the opium supplies that the british have brought in in the port of guangzhou then known as canton and basically threw it all into canton harbour while reciting a prayer over the waters to apologize for the to the goddess of the sea for actually polluting the water with all of these drugs he then basically gave a lecture to the uh british traders telling them not to be so foolish and so wicked as to bring this dreadful drug to china again and pretty much left it there thinking job done it turned out that that was not in fact the case it was a turning point in china's history because the british response was to send in the gunboats the chinese were really military i mean way behind you know they had invented gunpowder but they spent too much time making pretty fireworks and things like that and not developing the kinds of of weapons and weaponry after centuries of being an undisputed heavyweight china had little need for a large navy european countries however had been waging wars and building colonies around the world and were far more powerful than the chinese realized china's army and its ships were not a match for the british at all two successive wars followed as other european powers joined the fray to get their hands on china's resources but by this stage opium addiction in china was so bad that even the military was in its grip the emperor wasn't sure if he could even rely on the army because the troops were so subtle with opium and so given to taking opium it was a very serious problem in china in 1860 the second opium war ended the european powers were victorious and began to carve china up amongst themselves for centuries the world superpower china was forced to give up territory and open up various ports to the europeans amongst the most important was the handing over of a rather obscure little island on china's south coast called hong kong control of hong kong island gave the british empire better access to chinese trade and an island it would hold for 150 years but in a move that would have an even bigger impact the british and other europeans awarded themselves the right to live and trade freely in several cities along the coast of mainland china they became known for decades after that as treaty ports there were five of them but one became much more prominent than the others indeed one of the great cities of british empire you might say and that was the port city of shanghai areas were set aside for foreign residents where foreigners could live without having to pay any attention to china and chinese law they they operated under their own laws and and did very much as they pleased europeans got rich off the back of their new trade in china and enjoyed the high life they're living a fantastically good life masses of chinese servants it was an incredibly comfortable place to live from shanghai foreigners controlled most chinese industries mines mills and railways taxes prosperity rested as it always had on foreign guns and gun boats within whose shelter western pleasures undisturbed rolled off [Applause] at race courses and at resorts chinese appeared as always servants only but for the locals life wasn't quite so sweet chinese living in the city of shanghai could see that those foreigners would often behave in a rude and even violent way to local chinese knowing that they could not be prosecuted under chinese law under the treaty provisions they had to go to a special foreign court on chinese soil instead and that sort of inequality became a source of deep and bitter resentment even in the sort of early 20th century chinese weren't allowed to join the clubs that the foreigners had and so on they couldn't come to the country club they couldn't play tennis they couldn't this than the other so very very exclusive most chinese who lived in these following concessions would either be servants domestic helpers or traders merchants this was a terribly shameful experience the realization that china was essentially the plaything of a whole variety of other more powerful countries the opium wars and their treaties mark the start of what has become known in china as the century of humiliation but while china's glory days were fading things were about to get much worse today in china there's one event that unites this country's vast population of more than a billion people on december the 13th the nanjing massacre memorial day brings chinese people together to remember one of the darkest days in their history it commemorates the moment when their status as a global superpower would become ancient history [Laughter] by the early 20th century china's economy was no longer the world leader it had once been the chinese economy has suddenly bombed but it had not modernized in the way that european economies had china's neighbor japan had become the dominant power in the region japan had undertaken one of the most rapid modernizations in the world including modernization of its education its economy and of course its military japan wanted to continue to grow its empire and weaken china was an obvious target japan lacks raw materials it is very tiny doesn't have a lot of the things that china has and they they pushed into china and it was um it was hugely resented but there was very little the chinese could do about it the japanese were militarily superior in 1937 war officially began between the two countries as japan attacked shanghai july 1937 the war is on with shanghai first to take the shock the imperial navy shells shanghai at point-blank range a century since britain first blasted china open but now it must drink deeper of the cup of bitterness the inferior chinese army withstood the bombardment of shanghai for three months they sacrificed thousands of troops desperately hoping the onslaught would bring international help a few minutes before this picture was taken this hotel 20 stories high was filled with guests of all nations unmindful of the terror that stalked the skies now it's but a smoldering ghost of its former grandeur a massacre of non-combatants victims of an awful fate danger is anywhere and everywhere but the international community turned a blind eye and help never came after taking shanghai in december 1937 japanese troops marched towards nanjing or nan king which was then china's capital they'd expected to conquer china quickly and after three months of fighting in shanghai they were fired up for battle having been told wrongly by their commanders that china would fall like nine pins when they invaded they were angry resentful and bitter about the fact they had had to fight so hard by the time that they finally arrived at nanjing at the end of that year angry and nervous about chinese troops within the city walls the japanese embarked on a massacre that would go down in history the ray flanking is a it's an event which i think people still find it hard almost to explain it's um as if the japanese army had just been told you can do what you like i mean there was absolutely no thought of anything except really murdering and and humiliating and hurting china japanese troops essentially went on a rampage women were treated to the most obscene sort of sexual violence before being murdered many men were killed because it was suspected by the japanese that they were essentially soldiers who had taken off their uniforms they regarded prisoners of war as shackles as things they could just deal with in whatever way they saw fit if you look at the press the japanese press at the time that it was going on there are quite jocular reports about how two soldiers had a competition to see how many prisoners they could bayonet one soldier was reported to have killed 106 chinese prisoners and the other 105 during six weeks of massacre the final number killed is believed to be around 200 000. china was weaker militarily but now it was broken psychologically as well during that war more than 10 million chinese were killed more than 80 million chinese became refugees in their own country but in fighting against japan china soon found itself on the side of america britain and their allies in the second world war in 1945 when america dropped nuclear bombs on hiroshima nagasaki japan was forced out of the war china was free but the price it had paid during the war would affect it for generations china had been fighting against the japanese for about eight years it was utterly exhausted china was devastated the painful modernization it had been undertaking on everything from its railways to its roads to its agriculture all of these aspects of life were smashed beyond repair in addition china's economy was destroyed there was hyperinflation by the time the war was over china was essentially on its knees since the glory days of the ming dynasty china's star had fallen it had gone from being one of the most prosperous countries in the world to being just another developing country but a leader was about to emerge who would take china on the most dramatic journey of her long history today china has a new generation of big spenders there are more billionaires than any country except the united states and china now has the most high income households in the world and why not this is a culture with a thousand-year history of commerce invention and trade so far so capitalist and yet it's ruled by the communist party it just wasn't expected that a communist country would become possibly the world's biggest practitioner of capitalism so how did one of the most capitalist countries on earth end up being governed by a communist party [Laughter] this 32 meter giant of a statue costing around 300 million dollars was unveiled in 2009 in changsha it's the face of the farmer's son who would turn china's communist party into a dominant force as the country was ready for rebirth after its century of humiliation this is mao zedong he had a vision he had a message about china standing up to use the phrase that he put forward the idea of a century of humiliation in which china had been repeatedly invaded and occupied was going to end under his rule and then he put forward the idea of social justice that people would get land they would get food they would no longer be exploited if they were poor there's no doubting the attractiveness of the message which mao put forward to many of china's people in 1949 mao announced the birth of a new nation the people's republic of china he made the announcement at the entrance to the forbidden city home to so many emperors before him and as with previous emperors mao would assume total control and require total devotion our great teacher great leader great commander and great helmsman chairman now is the red sun in our hearts mao zedong's thoughts guide us in all our work mao thought as it became known was sacrosanct in china his philosophies were contained in the little red book today it's still admired by communists and socialists around the world we must learn to do economic work from all who know how no matter who they are we must esteem them as teachers learning from them respectfully and conscientiously he was part of people's lives his photo was everywhere you know he kind of really was it's almost like the only period in chinese history where you had this intense uh kind of spiritual unity where people all kind of have the same belief system but the adulation that mao came to expect led to some unusual displays of devotion now urge the popular sandy soldiers to use swimming as a training method while they swim they chant typical slogans such as forward braving the high waves to follow chairman mao as a water ballet it leaves a lot to be desired but they do keep time well [Applause] a waterlogged testament to fanatical loyalty and obedience which would be impressive if it weren't so ludicrous [Applause] one quite plausible way to talk about mao's status is to think of him as sort of a god he was regarded as to use one phrase at the time the shining red sun in all of our hearts and certainly the cult of personality that surrounded him was very much one that suggested almost the supernatural with the cultish devotion that he built around himself mao was willing to do whatever it took to transform china grandfather chairman mao knew his history he idolized the great nation builders of the imperial past and he saw himself like them as a benevolent despot as a man who needed to break heads to get things done and he even bragged about it he once said it didn't matter to him if millions of people died if he got the utopia that he was hoping for and in pursuit of that utopia that's exactly what would happen [Laughter] in 2019 china held a huge parade celebrating 70 years since the foundation of the people's republic at its heart was the smiling benevolent face of its founding father and yet the celebrations mask a complicated relationship between the people and a man whose policies still cast a long shadow in 1958 mao announced what he called the great leap forward a plan to take china through its own industrial revolution to boost the economy chairman mao decided making steel really isn't such a big deal everyone can do it you only need a backyard furnace and if everybody have a backyard furnace and you all work hard to produce steel then you will produce steel and china will be able to catch up with the uk surpass the uk and catch up with the united states so people were basically encouraged in mass campaigns to create brigades um and then they would sort of be told to kind of build you know kind of almost make your own furnaces and then put all of their sort of utensils and forks and things into this and create you know kind of steel a crazy crazy idea so you had you know kind of an industrialization but on the most sort of primitive and ineffective scale it is like doing it in your own back garden you know melting down cooking pots and hoping that you might be able to make a tractor out of them the steel that was produced from this means was of course no use to anybody but that didn't matter because it was about filling quotas rather than thinking through the idea of what you actually wanted the steel for and that anomaly that mistaken way of doing things basically doomed the entire great forward from the start an american documentary at the time condemned mao's efforts stupid as it was they thought they could replace modern smelting furnaces with manpower here was the result backyard furnaces which produced crude iron which cracked and splintered which was in a word useless but far worse than the poor quality steel was the effect on agricultural output mao had said something like sort of dig deep and um your corn will be better and so they they dug deep and they planted their seedlings down the bottom which all failed to thrive because of the lack of light you had you know the wrong crops grown in the wrong places and not particularly successful but you also had massive information problems where local officials often didn't report the problems such was the fear of disappointing mao that local party leaders lied about how much grain their regions were producing people wanted desperately to um to prove themselves to be more red than the next man you're more likely to get promotion or essentially gain praise if you said that your district was producing much more grain than anyone else figures were grossly exaggerated and gave a completely false picture of what um what was actually happening which was not a particularly brilliant um production the authorities thought well if there's so much grain there we can basically bag it up and export it to the soviet union to make money of course in a collective society where local officials could come in at any time raid your house find out what you were doing if you were caught hiding food you might essentially be beaten to death in front of your entire village or commune forced to hand over their food the results for this nation of peasant farmers were catastrophic huge amounts was being seized for sale and people were being left behind in the countryside with absolutely nothing to eat and the result of that of course was mass starvation they didn't move because they couldn't they couldn't because they were in effect being locked down they were not allowed to move and if you try to leave then soldiers will kill you the great leap forward led to one of the most horrific disasters in the history of modern china which was the famine that killed we don't really have exact figures but anything from 20 million up does seem to be at least arguable at least plausible the famine during the great leap forward has been called the greatest man-made disaster in history mao's efforts to resurrect china after its century of humiliation had resulted in mass starvation and an industrial policy that saw people melting pots and pans meanwhile around the globe a new world order was emerging america had become the dominant superpower russia had taken over eastern europe and formed the mighty ussr china once a world leader was an embarrassment but mao would soon unleash a new revolution bringing about one of the greatest moments of madness the world had ever seen over the last 1 000 years despite the sweeping changes of communism the chinese people have remained deeply rooted to the traditions of their past from a worship of ancestors to a reverence for chinese medicine and ancient superstitions it's a country steeped in history but in the 1950s its leader chairman mao wanted to read china of traditions that didn't reflect his vision of communism and there was one tradition in particular that he wanted to eradicate a tradition which prevented many women in the country from being the efficient communist workers that he wanted my great-grandmother on my mom's side did food binding she always works like a penguin with her banned food and we remember if we go to supermarkets we go to department store she couldn't walk very far she was always on a stick and i have never knew she was had a foot binding i remember very clearly one day while sitting there she unwrapping the tape beautiful very very long tape right and then she rolled it up beautifully so neatly into a bow and you see her foot i remember touching it's like a baby so soft at the end but her toes instead stretching out i remember it's curly inside it's incredible at that time i thought she had food disease over centuries bound feet had become a status symbol a sign that a woman didn't need to work in the fields generations of chinese women had been crippled by their parents when you are a baby probably three four they will break the bone and then bend your in all the bones inwards so you look like like this so instead stretching out it's like this then you wrap it very tightly in wet bandages which will then dry and tighten and the toes eventually end up completely curled under it is obviously enormously painful and it was done to little girls the mothers and the grannies do it because they fear that their daughters won't get married if they have big feet no one will want a girl with big feet and so you have to be tortured in this way the ideal size it is sanson jillian that means a three chinese inches golden lotus feet so about three inches so is from the middle of your hands to the top that's how small it is i mean even for a baby that's quite hard to achieve like for any anybody over the age of six and that is the ideal size if you achieved that my marvelous you will do your family proud and you're married to a very wealthy family and everyone will be happy ever after apart from you when you entire in this culture in the society sometimes you just don't questioning it we all just perform we all just fit into this instead of thinking how a minute do i really want to hurt my children like that after banning the tradition mao unleashed an army of anti-foot binding inspectors any women they found would have their bindings hung in their window to publicly shame them what the china now really did for china was he was the one said liberation for women they can go to schools have education work exactly like a man he liberated half of china's population to work for him to succeed in his revolution that's unprecedented for china and absolutely liberated the chinese women in the first level but mao's battle with the traditions that he felt held china back didn't end there he wanted to make china communist to the core not just his economics and politics but its culture too old traditions old beliefs old values had to go all that remained would be communism [Laughter] today mao's portrait is everywhere in china it's even on the money his face adorns the gates to the forbidden city one of china's grandest monuments to its cultural heritage and yet by the 1960s mao had become obsessed with eradicating what he called china's old customs and old culture the call to cultural revolution in 1966 was essentially the beginning by mao of an utterly unique political movement what he decided to do was to motivate various dissatisfied parts of china's population including the youth to argue that they must actually rise up against the chinese communist party itself under mao's leadership and renew the revolution he felt that you know young people were the only ones who are going to be sufficiently enthused and revolutionary and it was a very kind of disastrous and and and dangerous thing that he did the cultural revolution was really guided by a very utopian vision of mao's idea of a perfect socialist heaven and in fact for most people it ended up looking much like hell many schools and universities as symbols of the old establishment were forced to close religious shrines and many private possessions were destroyed millions of young people joined a youth militia known as the red guard they were told that the youth was the most valuable most dynamic part of society at the heart of china's communist revolution really lay in their hands for many of these young people that meant things like their teachers in school or their professors in university anyone who set themselves up as being in a position of power was automatically regarded as being corrupt they were given permission by the leader of the country to go wild against their elders and go wild many of them really did when the cultural revolution started my mom was only 14 years old one thing she always regretted was the fact that she didn't understand they were heavily manipulated by the teachers and the political parties inside the school it was every teacher to protect their own positions their own families so the teacher would nudge the students say go on this teacher is terrible it's never been very good we should do something about that but my mom refused to get into this but she has witnessed all of that happening with beating up the teacher robbery and they get beaten up it just become like house they become thugs parents could not trust their children and the children could not trust their parents husband could not trust the wife or vice versa because any one of them could be under pressure to snitch on the other in the hands of teenagers the revolution was spiraling out of control many people were paraded in public in what was called the airplane position by which you would have to hold out your arms at full length for hours on end immensely violent means we use such as simply beating assaulting hitting people who had offended against ideological purity anybody who says anything that is not complementary about chairman now that must be a class enemy but the humiliations and beatings were about to go too far one morning bien jong-yun a teacher in beijing showed up to work as usual she was beaten to death by her pupils i mean you can imagine that they start by throwing things humiliate and it gets worse and worse and worse and it is definitely a mass hysteria and once it's known about i mean half the world would be horrified and the other half would think let's go and do it to our teachers and so you have an enormous number of teachers in in high schools being beaten to death by their by their pupils despite the killings mao continued to support the red guard even appearing in tiananmen square not up on the rostrum but amongst the people many more deaths followed many people perished because they were regarded as being heretical so it was almost like a kind of medieval witch hunt for some people china at the end of the cultural revolution would be a place like north korea today potentially perhaps even more tightly controlled than north korea today in order to prove their revolutionary zeal some members of the red guard went to increasingly extraordinary lengths there were a few occasions when what perhaps one could call revolutionary cannibalism was being practiced and in those very extreme cases people were being asked to partake in the flesh of country revolutionaries who have been butchered and if one should refuse to do so one face the prospect of becoming the next serving i think that what what happens is that people think that that's the worst possible thing you can do and so what are you going to do to this this man who is my enemy who i have now defeated i'm gonna eat him or eat bits of him in some cases it's out of desperation because there are people with nothing else to eat but down in the south particularly around guangxi there was something much more sinister there was this idea that cannibalism was some kind of ritual revenge and that the party faithful were literally cooking and eating their enemies the estimated death toll caused by the cultural revolution ranged from hundreds of thousands up to 20 million but despite the catastrophic failures of the mao era almost 50 years after his death mao's memory is untouchable i think that the respect that there is in china of him today comes from essentially his role as a founder of the modern chinese state the fact that he led the revolution that ultimately led to china becoming a strong country a country that was finally secure in its own borders and one that was able to move from being essentially a destroyed post-war society in the late 1940s to becoming the country that would be on the verge of economic superpower status in the 1970s and mao would put china on the path to its economic superpower status by doing something utterly unexpected it would transform the country beyond recognition and has since been called the week that changed the world in the 1970s america was the world's dominant superpower it was liberal it was capitalist and it was successful china on the other hand was the world's biggest communist country they were sworn enemies there are 700 million chinese today one quarter of the human race and they are taught to hate their growing power is the world's greatest threat to peace and life but by this time mao had an even bigger enemy the soviet union which he felt had lost its way on the road to pure communism mao saw there was an advantage in trying to get closer to the us and unite against their joint foe the soviet union after over 20 years of no diplomatic communications between china and the us mao agreed to meet the american president 1972 saw us president richard nixon visiting china and visiting chairman mao and even now it's clearly a moment of huge historical significance in terms of the changing of the way in which two of the great world powers relate to each other nixon's visit to china in 1972 uh really reset relationships between you know the west and the east between china and america in particular nixon's visit was an iconic moment in chinese history because suddenly the great satan of america was going to be their friend again having met chairman mao nixon confirmed his hopes that the two countries could work together if our two people are enemies the future of this world we share together is dark indeed but if we can find common ground to work together the chance for world peace is immeasurably increased chairman mao has written seize the day seize the hour this is the hour this is the day nixon's visit really let the genie out of the bottle it had huge consequences for the rest of the world because china as a player in industry as a source of export goods but also as a market for import goods completely transforms all kinds of businesses all over the world the modern chinese super state that we see today began with nixon's visit to china because everything that happened stems from that in the decades that followed china achieved economic growth of around 10 percent a year with hundreds of millions of people lifted out of poverty i think that the effect of that meeting in terms of changes on china has been immeasurable i think very few people perhaps nobody in 1972 would have predicted that within half century china would become the second biggest economic power in the world for your average chinese in 1978 they would have a standard of living not different from what you have in north korea today perhaps even a bit worse but today china has the largest middle class anywhere in the world but despite china's adoption of some elements of western capitalism and despite the wealth that would follow the country showed no signs of embracing western democracy and on one infamous night it would show the world what happened to those who demanded reform a millennium ago china had the biggest population on the planet it still holds that title today with 1.4 billion people almost one in every five people in the world and for chairman mao growing china's huge population even more was key to making china great chairman mao in the 50s i think had said you know have as many children as you want the more chinese there are the better but it it became apparent that the chinese population was you know massive massively growing and was going to kind of outstrip food supply by the time mao died in 1976 a new leadership was beginning to see the huge population as a major problem in the mid 70s um it was already the case that if you worked in a factory or a library or a museum or whatever it that that would have its family planning policy so you know a factory would be told okay there can be two babies two babies born this year so they would say okay you and you and then the rest of you have to wait but the population wasn't coming down so the government took drastic action [Laughter] scientists working for the chinese government mostly actually in fields like rocket science rather than demography or sociology decided that the best solution was to limit people to simply one child each people who broke the rules could be forced to have an abortion and even be sterilized only in china can motherhood be not a joy but a crime this woman's offense was to conceive a second child well i tried to hide but there was no escape later two young girls operated so that i could not get pregnant again but to the government forced abortion and sterilization a mere bureaucratic process for the child that will never be born she has this receipt but apart from the loss of people's reproductive rights there was another huge problem one of the victims of the one child policy were girls who essentially found themselves being discriminated against either before or after birth in certain ways the assumption was that having a single girl in the countryside wasn't useful enough in terms of agricultural labor marrying out and so forth what do you do you have a choice you can have a baby daughter or you can terminate and therefore there were a lot of people who were choosing to do that there's certainly evidence in some places that maybe girls if they were born disappeared i mean very tragically that kind of is definitely reports of that i remember going down the yangtze one time and seeing a baby's body in the water and that was a girl and you know that that's sort of people did it all sorts of different ways i mean they didn't necessarily abort them but then you know if a girl was born she might be just drowned at birth or killed at birth recently the chinese government realized that with fewer children being born their population was gradually becoming older in 2015 they abolished the one child policy ending the most extreme state birth control project in history after 35 years but its effects will linger for generations there is an enormous gender imbalance now we are talking about tens of millions of chinese men who will never be able to find a wife in china because there are simply no not enough females in the country to marry them china is now looking at this sort of very very big demographic problem of having very very many old people and not many young people but for some in the population the one child policy had surprising benefits i wasn't even aware of the one child policy was oblivious to the entire concept until i came to britain in 1997 because suddenly people on the street were asking me where you from i said i'm from china say oh my god your girl how did you survive you didn't get killed or murdered such a foreign concept because all the people grown up around me just like me were all just one child we are the first generation of children born under the one child policy people who live in the city like me really benefited my parents were able to talk on me spend all their money so i could study abroad if i had a brother and sister that could never happen the one child policy really elevated women's position in the society because before if you have brothers and sisters everything is doted on the boy women was always part of the family that you're going to marry off it's something you can dispose of but when you only have one and she or he is everything you have you as a family give everything to them people in the cities life in china was getting easier they were richer most of them had only one child to raise the future was full of promise but as china got richer there were growing concerns about the direction the country was headed in as china was liberalizing economically there was a section within society who were being left behind they'd lost what was known as the iron rice bowl which is the guarantee of state protection of job security and of prices for certain commodities and suddenly they didn't have the kind of protections that communism used to offer them there was anger at government corruption and communist party corruption which had been building up in the previous years china had become quite an equal society as it became more open and you know kind of richer in 1989 a protest movement began that would become one of the greatest threats to the stability of communist party rule [Laughter] i arrived probably about a month after occupation square began they wanted a photographer that was going to just basically go there and glue him or herself to the news which is what i did the demonstration had begun in mid-april as a show of support in memory of the late huya bang the popular general secretary of the communist party he wasn't a liberal but he was quite a popular leader and seemed to listen to people and so his death really he kind of precipitated a lot of discontent and brought it to the surface illegal protests were not normally allowed in china it was allowed on this occasion because it started as a ritual for a former general secretary of the communist party which made it rather more difficult for the communist party to suppress it to begin with for a while an almost carnival atmosphere existed in the square as protesters for the first time had a sense of what it might be like to live in a liberal democracy it was like a rock festival it was uh upbeat uh music was playing it genuinely felt like an isle of wight festival or something sort of people stood up around the monument to the people's heroes people intense but gradually the vigil began to turn into a protest people came to the protest for different reasons there was quite a lot of annoyance about the lack of free speech in china you know people not being able to express themselves but corruption i think was a you know a very significant factor today teachers lawyers and trade union officials joined the throng so did prominent journalists from state television and communist party newspapers voicing their embarrassment at censorship of the students cause you have a kind of melting pot of annoyed people there are the students who want more reform who want more democracy and there are the the iron rice bowl people who want less reform and return to the way that things were you've got farmers who just want to get more money for their crops we've got all of these interest groups converging on the square and they're all angry with the communist party for one reason or another so the demonstrations continue and in some ways it got a lot bigger it became not only demonstrations by students but also by people in every walk of life with each day the sheer size of the protest had mushroomed at what must have been an alarming rate for the government in the middle of may 1989 soviet president mikhail gorbachev traveled to china for a summit bringing international media attention with him the dance for democracy did stop another summit event the carnival crowds preventing mr gorbachev reaching the great hall for his press conference troops sat helplessly in the corridors as journalists were told the conference had been moved to another venue if the soviet leader had arrived this is what he would have seen from the roof of the great hall of the people the seat of communist power marooned in an ocean of protest suddenly we saw the protest movement in beijing being splashed across the world it was enormously embarrassing for the chinese government and then on may 30th the demonstrators crossed a line this sort of 10 meter high styrofoam statue was wheeled into [ __ ] square staring out at the large portrait of chairman mao she's staring him right in the eyes it's an incredibly provocative gesture to make towards the center of chinese power it had a very clear resemblance to the statue of liberty a symbol of american independence that really annoyed the government the chinese government they saw it as inherently and deeply subversive that was the turning point four hours after it went up at ten o'clock on may the 30th china declared martial law and that meant that demonstrations were illegal it meant that foreign journalists were prescribed and weren't able to report live and the live links were shut down and the troops started to arrive 180 000 troops started to arrive from all over china on the 2nd of june the two sides if you like were on a collision course and nobody quite knew where that would end nobody knew the senior leaders done shopping and people around him they made the decision they could not countenance this kind of defiance and it was a life or death struggle so the knight of the third um was when the demonstrators were hanging on in gentlemen square determined not to leave and more and more there were these loud speakers surrounding the square advising people to go home to pack up um the troops arrived quite late and of course if you send in fully armed armored eunice and having indoctrinated the soldiers that there were counter-revolutionary rebels in beijing seizing control the soldiers would do exactly what they were expected to do they start shooting an apc was set on fire i saw a soldier wounded being carried away from the square [Applause] i turned around at one point and saw a demonstrator who'd been shot fall down killings continued through the night most of them away from tiananmen square itself anybody who talks about the [ __ ] square massacre is misdescribing what happened in beijing on that night most of the killing took place in the western suburbs of the city as the troops were arriving through it's unknown how many died between hundreds and a few thousand despite the trauma of the night the most abiding image of the event came the next day we could see um a row of demonstrators two royal rows of soldiers that were shooting at the demonstrators who were sort of refusing to move [Applause] from what i can gather about 20 people were killed right there and taken off on trishaws after a while um you know the demonstrators sort of retreated and a hole was kind of created through which the tanks about 12 of them started to roll up changing avenue going east and a man with two shopping bags had crossed into the middle of the road as if to block them tanks started to move down changan avenue he stood in front of the tank the tank did a sort of swervy ballad the whole incident lasted about three minutes the psb the public security bureau came and took him away took him to the other side of the road and that's the last we saw of him but stewart had captured a photograph of the moment and the following day it would be shown internationally once again attention around the world was drawn to china's assault on freedom to me photographing it on that day it didn't feel like very much but it's incredibly symbolic of you know the courage of somebody to stand up against you know the juggernaut of the state of of an entire army on your own i mean it takes an awful lot a lot of courage to do that single-handedly with all the risks that that entails um particularly somewhat like china um so i think it it it stands as a very very powerful symbol uh for for a lot of people the image of the tank man is is recognized all over the planet except in china where it's still censored from social media and if you run into someone who is prepared to discuss the chanan men incident in china it's not the photograph that they bring up the one that they're far more likely to mention is called the bus man and that's the image of uh people's liberation army soldier hanging from a burnt out bus and that's the message that the party wants to send within china that there was a dangerous counter-revolutionary rabble within the square and that they had to be stopped people growing up in china who were born after the beijing mexico for example do not know that the beijing mexican ever happened the protests have been described by some people as forgotten history in china so it's not uncommon for chinese students to come abroad and have never heard about this date 30 years since the massacre it still can't be discussed in china and now a new leader is threatening to take the country in an even more authoritarian direction the big question is whether china's increasing confidence can be contained within its borders or whether the whole world might soon have to bow to beijing for much of the last millennium it was china that led the world only for it all to come crashing down in a fall from grace unequaled in world history and yet the story of china today is that of a meteoric comeback from down and out melting pots and pans for steel to an industrial powerhouse and global superpower all in just half a century so what are the secrets behind this extraordinary reversal of fortunes and just how far could chyna go for many the answer lies with her ambitious current leader xi jinping was born soon after the end of china's century of humiliation and seems determined not to see china so humbled again xi jinping's vision for china is to create a powerful strong country and one which is wealthy so really xi jinping articulates this sense of national renaissance and of china which will never again be a victim of china which will never again be done down to ensure china's dominance first he secured as much power as possible for himself xi jinping is clearly the most powerful leader of china since module so the party constitution said that as president he should stand down in 2023 that's now been changed he can stand again it's very likely he will and he will probably stay in power as putin in russia uh for some considerable time i mean he's in his um sort of late 60s so in theory he could be around for quite a while before he even came to power china's economic reforms were already bearing fruit the chinese people's entrepreneurial spirit forged long ago during the sung dynasty constrained during its century of humiliation and the disastrous mao years was finally free again today the possibility of wealth is fueling a new chinese dream the dollar sign is everything and who has bigger cars who has better houses bigger tvs all of that materialistic thing become a signal of who you are that's the way of finding your identity in the society so the old way our courtesy generosity all of that's the thing that make china very proud of history is diminishing political power only comes with economical growth so in china everything is about how do you accumulate more wealth xi jinping's china is also a digital china where the party stay has capacities to monitor individuals in ways that was not imaginable previously when china was under chairman mao it was a totalitarian state there was not any aspect of life in china that was not under the control of the communist party so it is a much smarter better targeted version of an old-fashioned authoritarian system and a maoist totalitarian state the might of a huge workforce the power of an authoritarian government and the dynamism of capitalism have combined to make china unstoppable under xi jinping it's extended its massive construction boom to other countries and is building a huge development of roads and railways ports and pipelines across the world because china has done so well with its economic growth they need new markets there's only so many mobile phones you can sell to your domestic population there's only so many cars the chinese can buy they need to expand beyond china's borders into new markets xi jinping is trying to encourage the people of kazakhstan and uzbekistan to use chinese rail standards and to buy chinese trains and to use chinese architects and to basically extend china's markets beyond its own borders what it's doing is basically saying okay we are important we have a big economy i think for xi jinping this is the sort of geopolitical vision the vision of a society which now can live beyond its borders in a way that can reach out into the world around it a china which has the economy it does um can't really just restrain itself but as china's wealth has grown under xi so has its confidence it's already started flexing its military muscles in its own backyard the south china sea is an area of immense maritime dispute between china and many of its neighbors it's both a very rich area in terms of fishing and minerals and also because it's very important to have free access to the south china seas because that means that then access to the coast of east asia becomes much easier essentially china claims almost all of the south china sea as being historically chinese maritime territory so to speak to increase their claim on these waters china has been going to astonishing lengths finding semi-submerged sandbanks and turning them into islands in order to make that an island worth planting a flag in you've got to chuck tons of rocks in it and then surface it with cement so these are artificial islands so it's quite an insidious uh policy um designed to push china's borders uh further out not in terms of little areas around little islands but linking islands together so that china's general border is further out china has built runways on these artificial islands allowing them to increase their military presence in the area tensions with neighboring countries and the us have increased but china's latest front line of authoritarian expansion is one that has a bigger impact on the uk in 1997 britain handed control of hong kong back to china under the promise that some democratic rights would be preserved today demonstrations in hong kong have been continuing for more than a year as people see the freedoms they were promised by beijing disappear [Applause] i guess what was never expected in 1997 when the handover happened was that you would have you know kind of china explode economically um and so you know there's been an imbalance really china has come from sort of nowhere to being so economically important and i think that it's now less and less likely to inhibit what it wants to do in hong kong it feels very strong and confident there's a kind of proposal from beijing to have a sort of security law that seems to really kind of creep into hong kong's autonomy basically saying that beijing can say who is a sort of political problem and how they should be dealt with hong kong's autonomy has been eroded it still has some privileges but it's really questionable you know how sustainable those are going to be as it faces a beijing that's more and more kind of assertive the british took hong kong from china almost 200 years ago now china has taken it back the big question is just how aggressive china might become not just in its own backyard but across the world so this is very kind of uh you know sort of disconcerting that you've got this huge power but it doesn't really have a common political and cultural language with most of the other major countries so the west should be nervous about china for people who believe in the rights and dignity of the individual in the rule of law and in democratic system then the continued rise of china under the communist party and xi jinping is going to make your life not very pleasant the trouble is there may be very little that the west can do about it the 21st century belongs to china and that's not that weird an assertion to make because many previous centuries have as well throughout much of human history if a ufo landed on this planet and an alien said take me to your leader the emperor of china would probably be the natural choice and so there's been an anomaly for a few centuries but what we actually see now is a kind of a correction of china's centrality in the world order china's modern resurgence from down and out to world leader in just a few decades is perhaps the greatest success story of the 21st century but when told as part of her thousand-year history it should
